<p>The instructions that you use to upgrade an engine depends on how you installed the engine. When you upgrade the engine, you must also upgrade the blueprint design server.</p>
<ul>
<li>To upgrade an engine that you installed with the HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy installer in versions before 6.2.1.1, see <a href="../upgrade_engine_ucdp/">Upgrading engines that you installed with HCL UrbanCode Deploy</a>.</li>
<li>To upgrade from a version before 6.2.1.1 to version 6.2.2 or later, you can either migrate or extend the engine. See <a href="../migrate_engine_ucdp_script/">Migrating engines that you installed with HCL UrbanCode Deploy</a> and <a href="../upgrade_engine_extended/">Upgrading engines that you extended</a>.</li>
<li>To upgrade an engine that you installed with the HCL UrbanCode Deploy installer in versions 6.2.1.1 and later, see <a href="../upgrade_engine_extended/">Upgrading engines that you extended</a>.</li>
<li>
<p>To upgrade engines that you extended as described in <a href="../extending_an_engine_for_openstack/">Extending an existing OpenStack engine</a>, see <a href="../upgrade_engine_extended/">Upgrading engines that you extended</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="../upgrade_engine_ucdp/">Upgrading engines that you installed with HCL UrbanCode Deploy</a></strong><br />
To upgrade the engine, stop the related Heat services, install the new version, and restart the services. When you upgrade the engine, you must also upgrade the blueprint design server.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="../migrate_engine_ucdp_script/">Migrating engines that you installed with HCL UrbanCode Deploy</a></strong><br />
To migrate the Heat engine that is required for the HCL UrbanCode Deploy blueprint designer from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 6 to RHEL 7, stop the related Heat services, migrate the databases, install the new version, and restart the services</li>
<li><strong><a href="../upgrade_engine_extended/">Upgrading engines that you extended</a></strong><br />
To upgrade a Heat orchestration engine that you extended, rerun the script that extends the engine.</li>
