<p>Safe editing enables you to test component processes before making them available in normal environments. Make updates to your component process, test those updates safely, and then promote to a new version when you are ready.</p>
<p>Enable Safe Edit mode by completing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open installed.properties file in a text editor and add experimental.safeEdit.enabled=true. Navigate to the file by clicking <strong>(ucd)>server>conf>server>installed.properties</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Save</strong> file and restart the server.</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Settings > System Settings</strong>. Two new parameters are displayed below Component Settings. Select <strong>Enable Safe Edit of Component Processes</strong>, optionally select<strong>Require Approval to Promote Component Process</strong> and then click <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom of the System Settings page.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After server restarts, a background upgrade begins. You are unable to set new settings until the upgrade is complete. A progress bar is displayed next to Component Settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Settings > System Settings</strong>. Two new parameters are displayed below Component Settings. Select <strong>Enable Safe Edit of Component Processes</strong>, optionally select<strong>Require Approval to Promote Component Process</strong> and then click <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom of the System Settings page.</p>
</li>
<li>If <strong>Require Approval to Promote Component Process</strong> is enabled, after a draft is promoted you see Promotion Pending where the Promote push button was. The <strong>Promotion Pending</strong> button is inactive while an approval is pending. Approval requests go to anyone with manage processes permission on component. Under <strong>Work Items</strong>, there is a new Component Process promotion table with <strong>Approve</strong> and <strong>Reject</strong> actions. These actions link to latest promoted version and draft processes for which promotion was requested.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Component Settings containing two new parameters." src="../../images/component_settings_safe_edit.png" /> </p>
<p>You can edit component processes and component template processes without affecting deployments to protected environments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Under <strong>Environments</strong>, when you are editing the <strong>Allow Process Drafts to be deployed</strong> option, a new setting becomes available. After you select <strong>Allow Drafts to be Deployed</strong>, a new field, <strong>Component using Process Drafts</strong>, is displayed. Choose components for draft processes to run on.</li>
<li>On the Components tab, click the component name.</li>
<li>To <strong>Edit</strong> draft process, on the Processes tab, hover the cursor over the process to edit, and click the <img alt="pencilicon," src="../../images/pencil_icon.jpg" /> the pencil icon. <img alt="Process Designer with draft process buttons" src="../../images/process_draft_designer.png" /></li>
<li>Design your draft process, and then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
<li>Test the process in the environment you set up in step one.</li>
<li>When process works as expected, go back to the process designer, and click <strong>Promote</strong>. This action makes the process available for use or creates a promotion approval.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Lock</strong> to lock draft.The name of the person who locked the draft is displayed under <strong>Locked By</strong> on the Processes page. Only the person who holds the lock can edit the process. Under <strong>Actions</strong> a <strong>Force Unlock</strong> option is available.</li>
</ol>
<p>Environments that are set to allow draft processes can use draft process for deployments. Other environments must use the promoted processes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Snapshots can only lock to versions of component processes. They cannot lock to drafts. If a snapshot is deployed to an environment that allows drafts then one of these conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the snapshot is using the latest version of a process, the draft will be used.</li>
<li>If the snapshot is using a specific version of a process, then that specific version will be used.</li>
</ul>
