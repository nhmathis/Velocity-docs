<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>External Agent URL*</strong></td>
<td>This is the URL that the HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy server provides to agents as their point of contact. When an agent wants to contact the server, it retrieves this URL and opens a connection on it. This URL must point to the HTTP or HTTPS port of the server.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Skip Property Updates for Existing Agents</strong></td>
