# Release management

A release is a container for deployment plans, events, and properties.

A release is a repeatable plan that is used to drive deployments. You can schedule a release at any point in your development-operations lifecycle. Your releases can represent all kinds of events, from major events in the life of your company to comparatively minor events, like recurring maintenance.

Typically, a release contains deployment plans and events that are related in some business-meaningful way. For example, the deployment plans might represent the phases in a software development lifecycle, such as development, QA, and production. An event might represent a blackout that affects the release.

If a deployment plan in a release has user-defined properties, the tasks in the release's other deployment plans can reference them. In other words, properties have release scope.

If you add events to a release, you can use the calendar to filter the Releases page to display releases and deployment plans.

You can use pipelines to manage releases. Every application added to a pipeline has release and deployment plan templates generated for it. As jobs and apps are added to a pipeline, tasks are inserted in the default deployment plan. You can run deployments directly from the Pipeline page or from the Deployment plan detail page.

Use the release details page to view details about a specific release.
-   **[Managing releases](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_release_manage.md)**  
Release management is the process of managing, planning, scheduling and controlling a software build through different stages and environments; including testing and deploying software releases.
-   **[Creating releases](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_release_create.md)**  

-   **[Archiving releases](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_release_archive.md)**  
You can archive a release to remove it from the list of releases.
-   **[Events and tags](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_events_ov.md)**  
An event represents a release-related activity that you manage with the calendar. A tag is a label that you can add to a release or an event. You can use tags to filter the Activities list on the Releases page. Tags do not appear on the calendar.
-   **[Restoring archived releases, plans, and templates](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_restore_archive.md)**  
You can restore archived releases, deployment plans, and templates.
-   **[Deployment plans](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_deployPlan_ov.md)**  
A deployment plan is a container for tasks. Tasks define the activities that your team runs to complete a software deployment.
-   **[Running deployments](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_deployRun_ov.md)**  
Complete deployments by resolving the tasks in a deployment plan.
-   **[Tasks](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_task_ov.md)**  
A task represents a business-meaningful activity that is associated with a software deployment. Each task is defined on a separate row in a deployment plan. During a deployment, you run tasks defined in the deployment plan to complete the deployment.
-   **[Using properties](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_properties_ov.md)**  
A deployment plan can contain user-defined properties. Properties values can be defined at design- or run-time.
