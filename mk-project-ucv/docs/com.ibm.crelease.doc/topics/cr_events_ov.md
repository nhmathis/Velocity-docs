# Events and tags

An event represents a release-related activity that you manage with the calendar. A tag is a label that you can add to a release or an event. You can use tags to filter the Activities list on the Releases page. Tags do not appear on the calendar.

Events are organized into general categories that include releases, holidays, and maintenance windows. You can add events to releases or use them independent of releases. When an event is assigned, it is represented on the calendar by an icon appropriate for the event category. You can use the icons to filter the Releases page and select releases for any affected date or range of dates.

Tags are assigned to releases and can be used to filter the Releases page. Assigned tags appear in Releases page but they do not appear on the calendar. You can use tags to avoid calendar clutter.
