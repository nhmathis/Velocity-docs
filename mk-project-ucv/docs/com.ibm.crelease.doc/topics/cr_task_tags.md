# Managing task tags

Tags are organizing elements that you can add to tasks. You can filter deployment plans by tag. For example, during a deployment to a production environment, you might disable tasks with the \`DEV\_only\` tag, which is intended to be used only in development environments.

To add a tag to a task, complete the following steps:

1.   On the Deployment Plan Details page, select a task or task group, and then click Manage Tags ![manage tags](../images/task-tag.png). You can select multiple tasks and groups. 
2.   In the Manage Tags for Selected Tasks dialog box, in the **Common Tags** list, select tags. You can create a new tag by typing a name in the list's text box. 
3.   Click **Save**. Tags are displayed on the task rows in the Deployment Plan Detail page. In the following figure, the Deploy WAR task has two tags assigned to it, `Deployment`, and `Critical`.

    The tags used by a deployment plan are displayed on the Deployment Plan Detail page **Versions** tab. To render tasks with a specific tag `Not Applicable` for a deployment, clear the tag. Tasks with the `Not Applicable` status cannot be started.
