# Creating tasks

By default, new tasks are inserted at the bottom of the deployment plan. After a task is created, you can move it, or copy it and paste it into another deployment plan. [You can also create dependencies with other tasks](cr_task_depend.md#).

Tasks can be added to a deployment by creating a new task or importing an existing task.

After you save a task, action icons are displayed for the task. You use action icons to change the task's status during a deployment. All tasks have the **Skip** action icon. Other icons, such as **Start**, are displayed when the context is appropriate for them.
