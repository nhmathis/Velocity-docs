# Creating delay tasks

Delayed-type tasks represent milestones or critical events during a deployment. With delayed tasks, you can ensure that important tasks start at the expected time. Typically, delayed tasks are prerequisites for other important tasks.

A delayed task starts as soon as it is eligible to run, and it finishes at a user-specified time. A started delayed-type task has a status of \`In Progress\` until it reaches its planned-for time, when it then changes its status to \`Complete\`. When a delayed tasks completes, auto tasks that are dependent on it start running.

Complete the following tasks to create a delayed task:

1.   On the Deployment plan detail page, click **Create Task**. If you want to insert a task at a specific position in the plan, select a task before using the **Create Task**. The new task is inserted above the selected task.
2.   On the Create Task dialog box, in the **Type** list, select **Delayed**. 
3.   In the **Name** field, enter a name for the task. 
4.   In the **Delay type** field, select the method used to determine the length of the delay. If you select \*\*Delay by selecting a time and time zone\*\*, use the \*\*Time\*\* and \*\*Time Zone\*\* fields to specify when the task will complete. Otherwise, enter a property name in the \*\*Delay property\*\* field. The property value can be set at run-time when the deployment starts. \[See the Properties reference for information about properties\]\(/docs/services/UCCR/UCCR\_property\_ref.html\#property\_overview\)
5.   Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.
