# Managing releases

Release management is the process of managing, planning, scheduling and controlling a software build through different stages and environments; including testing and deploying software releases.

The Release page displays information about releases. This page provides access to the calendar, release and task details.

Release activities are displayed in a tile or list \(![](../images/icon_releasepage.jpg)\) format. You can use filters to limit the amount of information shown by typing a filter in the search bar. Additionally, click the filter icon \(![](../images/icon_charts_filter.jpg)\) to limit the activity list to: complete, in progress, or scheduled. Click the release name to view details about the release.

Click the tag icon \(![](../images/icon_releasetags.jpg) \) to toggle on and off the displaying of tags associated with the release activity.

To create a new release, click **Create release**.
