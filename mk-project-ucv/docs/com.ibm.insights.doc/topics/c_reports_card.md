A card is a summary of metrics for a specific deployment data. Each card focuses on a specific set of metrics. You can select any number of cards to display in a report.

Detail information for each card can be view by clicking the horizontal dots \(![](../images/horizontaldots.jpg)\) at the top right of the card. Select **Report data** to view the details. The details allow you to drill down into the summary metric provided on the card.
