# License management

UrbanCode™ Velocity Standard Edition provides a 60-day license-free evaluation period.

Unless you configure a license when you install UrbanCode Velocity Standard Edition, a 60-day evaluation period begins. During evaluation, you can use all product features. By the end of the 60-day trial, you must configure a license. You can apply a license at any time.

**Note:** The UrbanCode Velocity Community Edition is free to use and does not require a license.

For more information about setting up a Rational® Common Licensing server and applying licenses, see the Rational Common Licensing help: [Rational Common Licensing documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSTWP_8.1.6/com.ibm.rational.license.doc/helpindex_RCL.html)

The [Rational License Key Center](https://licensing.subscribenet.com/control/ibmr/login) is an online licensing tool. You can use this tool to generate or return your IBM Rational product license keys.
