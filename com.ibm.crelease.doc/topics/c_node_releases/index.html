    <h1 id="release-management">Release management</h1>
<p>A release is a container for deployment plans, events, and properties.</p>
<p>A release is a repeatable plan that is used to drive deployments. You can schedule a release at any point in your development-operations lifecycle. Your releases can represent all kinds of events, from major events in the life of your company to comparatively minor events, like recurring maintenance.</p>
<p>Typically, a release contains deployment plans and events that are related in some business-meaningful way. For example, the deployment plans might represent the phases in a software development lifecycle, such as development, QA, and production. An event might represent a blackout that affects the release.</p>
<p>If a deployment plan in a release has user-defined properties, the tasks in the release's other deployment plans can reference them. In other words, properties have release scope.</p>
<p>If you add events to a release, you can use the calendar to filter the Releases page to display releases and deployment plans.</p>
<p>You can use pipelines to manage releases. Every application added to a pipeline has release and deployment plan templates generated for it. As jobs and apps are added to a pipeline, tasks are inserted in the default deployment plan. You can run deployments directly from the Pipeline page or from the Deployment plan detail page.</p>

</li>
<li><strong><a href="../cr_events_ov/">Events and tags</a></strong><br />
An event represents a release-related activity that you manage with the calendar. A tag is a label that you can add to a release or an event. You can use tags to filter the Activities list on the Releases page. Tags do not appear on the calendar.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../cr_restore_archive/">Restoring archived releases, plans, and templates</a></strong><br />
You can restore archived releases, deployment plans, and templates.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../cr_deployPlan_ov/">Deployment plans</a></strong><br />
A deployment plan is a container for tasks. Tasks define the activities that your team runs to complete a software deployment.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../cr_deployRun_ov/">Running deployments</a></strong><br />
Complete deployments by resolving the tasks in a deployment plan.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../cr_task_ov/">Tasks</a></strong><br />
A task represents a business-meaningful activity that is associated with a software deployment. Each task is defined on a separate row in a deployment plan. During a deployment, you run tasks defined in the deployment plan to complete the deployment.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../cr_properties_ov/">Using properties</a></strong><br />
A deployment plan can contain user-defined properties. Properties values can be defined at design- or run-time.</li>
